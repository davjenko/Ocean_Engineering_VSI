Python code for final models in Comprehensive Prediction of Subaerial Landslide-Tsunamis via Slide Model- and Water Body Geometry-Invariant Machine Learning Techniques.

Each labelled folder contains Python code to define the final model created for each prediction variable, the normalised testing data set, and the model definition and weights files.

The results from each line of code are visible in this Github repository, but can be further verified by downloading all of the files in a given folder, ensuring all Python package requirements are met, then running the Python code in jupyter-notebook. Please contact David Gwillym Jenkins (david.jenkins@ntu.ac.uk) with any questions.
